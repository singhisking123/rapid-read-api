# RAPID-READ-API
  - This is an API built by me to perform all possible actions on a book or a collection of books in library for proper maintainance.
  - It involves all API calls of put, post, get and delete which were tested using postman.
  - The database for this project is built on MongoDB. The database consists of 3 collections namely Books, Authors and Publications which stores every single detail about the book, author and publication respectively. The collections are connected to each other in a proper way.
## Actions
- CRUD operations for a book.
- CRUD operations for an author.
- CRUD operations for a publication.
- Changes in authors and publications collections will be cascaded to books collection.
