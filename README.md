# Book-API
  -> This is an API built by me to perform all possible actions on a book or a collection of books in library for proper maintainance.<br />
  -> It involves all API calls of put, post, get and delete which were tested using postman.<br />
  -> The database for this project is built on MongoDB. The database consists of 3 collections namely Books, Authors and Publications which stores every single detail about the 
    book, author and publication respectively. The collections are connected to each other in a proper way.
  -> Some of the actions done in API calls are :- <br />
      * Adding/deleting/Updating/Fetching a book.<br />
      * Adding/deleting/Updating/Fetching an author.<br />
      * Adding/deleting/Updating/Fetching a publication.<br />
      * The changes that are to be made in authors and publications collections on doing any change in books collections are also taken care of and vice-versa.
      
### Its a complete backend project where I built a working API which would help libraries in maintaining the books and its details properly.
